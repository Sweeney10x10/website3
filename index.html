                Specialist with 15+ years’ experience of supporting global Banking, Investments 
                and Insurance organizations with £100m+ mission-critical projects and transformation 
                programmes. I started my career in the finance and investments world before becoming a freelance consultant 
                in 2007 focused on providing technology and data expertise to help finance teams 
                achieve their goals and objectives. I am usually hired by finance organizations that 
                need my combined experience and skills across finance, technology, data, reporting and 
                project-management. I hugely enjoy problem-solving opportunities where I can combine my 
                background in fintech programmes with my love of complex data and coding to help create 
                valuable insights and information that help business leaders make intelligent strategic decisions.</p><br/><br/>

                        I designed and built a solution to enable a banking finance team to import financial projection 
                        data via webforms.
                        I automated the capture of additionally required data from 
                        databases and the datawarehouse, storing everything in a new database. 
                        Finally, I updated the master forecasting templates, 
                        replacing all manual processing with automation scripts.

                        I created a solution to automate an investment team's processes for creating pension projections. 
                        I built a new database and automated the loading of required data from multiple source systems. 
                        I built a new Financial Modelling template containing the 
                        calculations needed for generating forecasts. I then automated the creation of 
                        export files for import into the finance system.

                        With all change control data now stored centrally, 
                        this finally created the possibility to develop robust, real-time project reporting

                        members to capture resource information via standard forms, storing this in a new database. 
                        This solution replaced very manual and time-consuming data import-export 
                        tasks with automated extract-transform-load scripts. Finally, I replaced the manual Excel reporting

                        to extract, transform and load the required data. I then created a data model

                        financial systems into a CSV format. Then using the Pandas library, I wrote the required Python scripts
                        to model the data and generate the premium illustrations.

                        I created an automated solution for generating the regulatory returns required by the Bank of England
                        for a UK bank. This work required a great deal of business analysis work where I needed to study the
                        regulatory requirements in order to ensure that the correct figures were produced. 
                        My final solution completely automated the production of these returns.

                        transformed business to support the business case. This required extraction

                        I designed and built a web application to help a global investment company

                        being done using Excel spreadsheets. It enabled them to allocate resources
                        to multiple projects and for the resource time to be allocated allowing accurate costings
                        for company wide projects.

                        in the new database. Finally, my solution enabled the

                        I created a database-driven Financial Model for a global bank to enable the build of projections of
                        costs in excess of a billion pounds. Due to it's complexity, the model required financial and non-financial data
                        from multiple sources in order to build the assumptions. My solution enabled us
                        to apply scenarios and parameter values to build forecasts.

                        and produced a fully calculated file ready for import into the finance system.

                        enabled us to build 5 year projections. The build involved modelling of savings, mortgages
                        and loan products and involved complex calculations of derivatives.
