            <h2>About Me</h2><br/>
            <p>
                
                Hello! I'm Chris Sweeney, a UK-based Financial Data Intelligence
                Specialist with 20 years of experience supporting global banks, investment firms 
                and insurance companies with £100m+ transformation programmes and mission-critical projects. <br/><br/>
                
                Starting my career as an accountant in finance and investments, I transitioned into freelance consultancy 
                in 2007. Since then, I’ve helped multiple organizations harness the power of technology and data to transform raw data into actionable insights.<br/><br/>

                Clients usually bring me in when they need someone who speaks both finance and tech - someone who understands financial terminology yet can also build the systems, data models, financial models and dashboards to support strategic decisions.
                
                I love solving complex problems and thrive on projects where I get to combine my finance background with my passion for coding, analytics and data

                to deliver cutting-edge Financial Data Intelligence solutions that turn complex data into actionable insights.<br/><br/>
                
                Ultimately, I’m here to transform your financial data into
                valuable, actionable insights - helping you and your finance teams make faster, smarter decisions by turning data into clarity, and clarity into action.

            <h2>What is Financial Data Intelligence?</h2><br/> 
            <p> Financial Data Intelligence (FDI) is the practice of turning complex financial data into actionable insights that support smarter, faster business decisions. It goes beyond raw numbers, dashboards, or automated reports—FDI combines financial expertise, advanced analytics, business intelligence, and consultancy to deliver clarity and impact. </p><br/> 
            <p> The secret to effective FDI isn’t just technology—it’s understanding the real-world challenges, complexities, and opportunities that organisations face. This involves: </p> 
            <ul> <li>Listening carefully to stakeholders and understanding their goals and pain points</li> <li>Mapping complex financial processes and identifying hidden risks or inefficiencies</li> <li>Designing tailored data, modelling, and reporting solutions that solve real business problems</li> <li>Bringing together finance, technology, and strategy to turn insights into actionable decisions</li> </ul> 
            <p> By applying FDI, organisations can uncover trends, optimise performance, and make evidence-based decisions—whether it’s improving forecasting, regulatory reporting, investment analysis, or operational efficiency. </p><br/> 
            <p> Explore my <a href="#financial-data-intelligence-projects" title="Financial Data Intelligence Projects">Financial Data Intelligence projects</a> to see how these techniques are applied in real-world scenarios, from automation and predictive modelling to strategic decision support. </p>
