            <h2>About Me</h2><br/>
            <p>
                
                Hello! My name is Chris Sweeney and I'm a UK-based Financial Data Project 
                Specialist with 20 years experience supporting global banks, investment firms 
                and insurance companies with £100m+ transformation programmes and mission-critical projects. <br/><br/>
                
                Originally an accountant, I began my career in finance and investments before transitioning into freelance consultancy 
                in 2007. Since then, I’ve helped multiple organizations harness the power of technology, data, and reporting to drive informed decision-making.<br/><br/>
                
                I love solving complex problems and thrive on projects where I can combine my finance background with my passion for coding and analytics. <br/><br/>

                Clients usually bring me in when they need someone who speaks both finance and tech - someone who understands financial terminology yet can also build the systems, data models, financial models and dashboards to support strategic decisions.<br/><br/>
                
                Ultimately, I’m here to transform your data into
                valuable, actionable insights - helping your finance teams make smarter decisions by turning data into clarity, and clarity into action.
            
            </p><br/><br/>

                        I designed and built a solution to enable a banking finance team to import financial projection 
                        data via webforms.
                        I automated the capture of additionally required data from 
                        databases and the datawarehouse, storing everything in a new database. 
                        Finally, I updated the master forecasting templates, 
                        replacing all manual processing with automation scripts.

                        I created a solution to automate an investment team's processes for creating pension projections. 
                        I built a new database and automated the loading of required data from multiple source systems. 
                        I built a new Financial Modelling template containing the 
                        calculations needed for generating forecasts. I then automated the creation of 
                        export files for import into the finance system.

                        within this global bank to capture project change control information centrally in a new database. 
                        With all change control data now stored centrally, 
                        this finally created the possibility to develop robust, real-time project reporting

                        to extract, transform and load the required data. I then created a data model

                        I started by creating SQL scripts to automate the extraction of required data from the source
                        financial systems into a CSV format. Then using the Pandas library, I wrote the required Python scripts
                        to model the data and generate the premium illustrations.

                        I created an automated solution for generating the regulatory returns required by the Bank of England
                        for a UK bank. This work required a great deal of business analysis work where I needed to study the
                        regulatory requirements in order to ensure that the correct figures were produced. 
                        My final solution completely automated the production of these returns.

                        a 5 year financial model, projecting the P&L, Balance Sheet and Cashflow for the 
                        transformed business to support the business case. This required extraction

                        I designed and built a web application to help a global investment company

                        to multiple projects and for the resource time to be allocated allowing accurate costings
